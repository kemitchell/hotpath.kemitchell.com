## Intellectual Property

"Intellectual property" is a general term for property-like legal rights in things that aren't tied to specific land or physical objects.

Like property rights in land or physical objects, intellectual property rights give their owners legal power to stop other people from doing things with what they own.

Four kinds of intellectual property rights commonly matter in computer software:

Copyrights cover copying and publishing computer code.  Since computers copy code to do pretty much anything with it, copyrights are very important.

Patents cover using and selling new and useful inventions published through the government patent office.  In years past, there was a big rush to patent lots of inventions usually implemented in software, especially in the United States.  These days it's harder to get and enforce a so-called "software patent", but it still happens, and a lot of old patents haven't reached their expiration dates.

Trademarks cover the use of names and logos in ways that imply something about who's behind products and services.  Companies, standards organizations, and specific products and services often have trademarks.

Trade secrets cover discovering and using confidential information that people and companies take steps to protect.  Public source code and inventions that fall under copyright and patent rights often start life as trade secrets.  Some people and companies intentionally choose to keep work as trade secrets, rather than publicize it and rely on copyrights or patents to protect their interests.
